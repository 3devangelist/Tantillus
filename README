Tantillus

Introducing Tantillus. The portable self replicating mini printer.


--Status--

Feb 9, 2012

    Alpha unit assembled and ready for testing. 


--Design goals--

    Portable
    Self replicating
    Compact
    Fast
    Printable frame
    Expandable 


--Specifications--

Outer dimensions:

    200mm x 200mm x 300mm (225mm x 225mm x 300mm with reinforcements brackets installed, see picture) 

Build Area:

    102mm x 102mm x 120mm (100mm x 100mm x 110 usable) 


--Features--

    LM8uu linear bearings on all axis (currently using Triffid Hunters printable LM8uu's for testing with excellent results).
    Fully printed case.
    It can print all of its own parts.
    Designed to use J-head hotend (eventually).
    Internally mounted extruder with bowden cable.
    External power supply to allow for battery operated use.
    Uses low cost wire rope (fishing wire) or High test Braided fishing line instead of costly belts (It wraps 5 times around the rod and then goes through a hole and wraps an additional 5 times resulting in no slip). This is a roll on roll off system with a fixed anchor in the middle. 


Planned additions:

    Extension panels to allow it to expand itself by 100mm in any or all directions (incomplete as of yet).
    The ability to daisy chain two machines together to mass produce parts while only using one set of electronics (both machines would produce the same parts at the same time).
